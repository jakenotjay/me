description: "The ukfields dataset is a publicly accessible Earth Engine asset of automatically delineated field boundaries spanning England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Samuel Bancroft did the majority of the work for this dataset, while I built a private process that mirrored it in parallel for my employer at the time."
