Welcome to my blog! This is where I'll be sharing my thoughts, learnings, and experiences.

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:

- Technical deep-dives and tutorials
- Lessons learned from projects
- Interesting problems I've encountered
- Thoughts on the industry

## A Code Example

Here's a simple code block to show how syntax highlighting works:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet('World');
```

## Including Images

You can include images in your posts by placing them in `src/assets/` and referencing them:

```markdown
![Alt text](../../assets/your-image.png)
```

Or for images in the `public/` folder:

```markdown
![Alt text](/your-image.png)
```

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. It's useful for highlighting important points or quoting others.

Thanks for reading, and stay tuned for more!
